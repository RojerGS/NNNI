# NNNI
Neural Networks with No Imports (in Python)

## Roadmap

Things that need to be done:

 - [x] activation function (Leaky ReLU)
 - [x] a class to represent a single layer
   - [x] a class to represent matrices
   - [ ] operations on matrices
     - [x] matrix multiplication
     - [x] random matrix generation
     - [x] matrix multiplication with scalars
     - [x] component-wise maximum
     - [ ] matrix addition
     - [ ] other (?)
   - [ ] forward pass
 - [ ] loss function
 - [ ] a class to represent a network
   - [ ] forward pass
   - [ ] backpropagation algorithm
 - [ ] read the MNIST data
 - [ ] train the network
